Bug-Reports

Adventurer card:
   - cardtest1
   - Specific Tests Failed:
	- Comparing Resulting Hand & Expected Hand counts
		- Resulting Hand > Expected Hand by 1
	- Comparing Resulting Played Card & Expected Played Card counts
		- Resulting Played < Expected Played by 1
   - Bugs Found:
	1. Deck card not added to “discard” deck
		- Where in Code:
			- Missing “discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);” in adventurerCardEffect
		- How to Reproduce:
			- Have deck with multiple non-treasure cards to be drawn prior to 2 treasure cards.  Compare decks of the hand before and after 
			  Adventurer is completed.  You will find that 1 of the cards disappears from all decks completely when it should have been added 
			  to the discard deck.
	2. Hand card not added to “played” deck
		- Where in Code:
			- Line 1240
			- Current Code:	while(z - 1 > 0)
			- Should Be:	while(z - 1 >= 0)
		- How to Reproduce:
			- Set the first card in the player’s hand so that it is distinct from all of the other cards.  Call the function and compare the 
			  first card in the deck to the distinct card.  If these two cards match, the card was not removed from the player’s hand.  Now check 
			  and see if playedCardCount is greater than the previous playedCardCount by only 1.  Compare the newest card in the hand to the 
			  distinct card.  If they do not match, it was not added to the played deck.

Smithy card:
   - cardtest2.c
   - Specific Tests Failed:
	- Comparing Resulting Hand and Expected Hand counts
		- Resulting Hand < Expected Hand
	- Testing Hand Count Card Gain
		- Resulting Hand did not gain 3 cards & discard Smithy
   - Bugs Found:
	1. Only 2 cards from the deck were added to the player’s hand instead of 3.
		- Where in Code:
			- Line 1252: 
			- Current Code:	for( i = 1; i < 3; i++)
			- Should be: 	for( i = 0; i < 3; i++)
		- How to Reproduce:
			- Initiate a game and set the first card in the player’s hand to be Smithy.  Print out the current player’s hand and deck.  Call 
			  the cardEffect function and pass it “Smithy” as the card for the current player.  Print out the player’s hand and deck once again.  
			  3 of the cards from the deck should have migrated into the player’s hand and Smithy should have been discarded from it, thus the 
			  overall count of the player’s hand should have increased by 2.  Based on the printed statements, only 2 cards were moved from the 
			  deck into the player’s hand instead of the 3.  Thus, the hand and deck do not accurately depict the expected behaviour of Smithy.
